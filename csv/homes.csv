This was soon followed by our first multi-field in Kolkata in 2011, bringing together all the stalwarts of Indian hockey. And a host of cricket wickets, further championing the cause of the sub-continent, not to mention another hockey field.","In 2012 we took the playground to the skies in Rajkot, building atop rooftops a playing area for cricket, hockey, tennis and recreation. We followed this building a football field in New Delhi and infilling with natural, green rubber and introducing the only yarn in the world with an unlimited play warranty"," 2013 witnessed the only water-efficient hockey field in India with play possible both wet and dry followed by a host of multi sport play fields in schools across the country. Our install and civil team were now fully geared to bring a smile on every sports enthusiast.","The Liverpool Academy’s football field in Pune was built by us, ground up, and now home to the DSK Shivajians. We also built our first indoor play area with a lifetime warranty, in Chennai. 2014 was indeed a year of exciting firsts. At the same time, our multi fields grew not just in number, but also in size.","The single largest playing field in India, Jio Gardens, ideal not just for football but events and recreational use as well, was completed by us in 2015 in Mumbai, graced by a galaxy of stars from every walk of life. We also commenced work on IAAF approved athletic tracks, sprinting ahead with our commitment to sport.","The FIFA Goal Project field was completed by us in 2016 at Tsirang, Bhutan; a host of installations on a turnkey basis was completed by us in Nepal, across venues, including football and basketball; the FC Barcelona Academy was another feather in our cap and the numbers of multi fields, futsal fields and recreational areas kept growing. Our IAAF athletic track, at Gwalior, was certified Class 1 in 2016 – one of only two such tracks in India!"," As we begin 2017, we commence work on yet another FIH Global Hockey Field; a diverse multi turf sport field on a cushioned pad; a football field using our special fibre that remains cooler than all conventional yarns – to name but a few. We look forward to  the growing “pug marks” and our continued commitment to “the love of the sport.”",HAPPY CLIENTS,“I would like to place on record mine and my organisation’s immense gratitude and thanks for the stupendous workmanship and exemplary performance shown by Altius Sports in completion of the “Raptors Field” in our school.,An all-weather field is one of the most complex and technologically challenging projects in the whole gamut of operations in an  international school and Altius Sports has played a stellar role in partnering with AISC to make this a grandstanding success cutting across deadlines and various obstacles which are encountered in a project of such magnitude.”,Alankrit Arora,"Director Business Affairs,","  AIS, Chennai","“It is hereby committed that M/S Altius Sports, Kolkata who have successfully completed construction and maintenance of a world class football ground using Tiger Turf, have done us proud with their dedication and technical excellence with utmost professionalism.
